It's the first site update of 2024 :confetti_ball:

The site has a new name and a new domain: **:e[|https://downtranslated.com]**.
Unfortunately I haven't had a chance to rebrand the site itself, but expect that
in a future update.

Changes:

* I'm now hosting the site myself at :e[|https://downtranslated.com]
* :e[|https://0E9B061F.github.io] continues to exist as a mirror
* Added a mirror at :e[|https://0E9B061F.gitlab.io]
* Consolidated site into a single repo
* Updated frontpage software listings
* Added a :i[Gallery item|gallery>fantasma-basic-example]
