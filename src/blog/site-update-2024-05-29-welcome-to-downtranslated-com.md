It's the first site update of 2024 :confetti_ball:

The site has a new name and a new domain: **[downtranslated.com][dt]**. Unfortunately I haven't had a chance to rebrand the site itself, but expect that in a future update.

Changes:

* I'm now hosting the site myself at [downtranslated.com][dt]
* [0E9B061F.github.io][m1] continues to exist as a mirror
* Added a mirror at [0E9B061F.gitlab.io][m2]
* Consolidated site into a single repo
* Updated frontpage software listings
* Added a [Gallery item][example]
