Updated :european_castle: :gh[|0E9B061F/ghast.js] to `v0.6.4`. The last update
had the wrong version in the README (orz). This fixes that and belatedly updates
the year to 2023.

:i[The project's documentation|docs>ghast.js] has also been updated to reflect
these changes.

# CHANGES

* Update version number and year in `README.md`
