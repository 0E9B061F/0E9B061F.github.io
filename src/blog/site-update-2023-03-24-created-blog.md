:e[|https://0E9B061F.github.io] has been updated! A blog ---
creatively named the *:i[Work Log|blog>]* --- has been added, as well as a
:i[Gallery|gallery>].

* The :i[Work Log|blog>] will feature updates to this site and my projects, as
  well as more general notes about programming, design, and related topics.
* The :i[Gallery|gallery>] contains samples of my work.

Thank you for visiting and reading our inaugural post. *(Ed.: a few posts have
been back-dated but this is the first one, I swear.)*
