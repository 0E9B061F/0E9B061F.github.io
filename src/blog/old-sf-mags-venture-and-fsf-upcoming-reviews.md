I recently picked up a couple of old sci-fi magazines --- *:w[The Magazine of
Fantasy & Science Fiction]* :sfp[(March 1969)|61261] and *:w[Venture Science
Fiction]* :sfp[(May 1969)|104291], chosen mostly based on their covers. I'll
be doing mini-reviews when I get around to reading them. In the mean time, I'll
share some pictures and information about each.


# The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction, March 1969

::fig[*F&SF* cover, March 1969]{#fsf-001-001}

Founded in 1949, the venerable *F&SF* is still being published today. This issue
features two *novelets*, five short stories, a cartoon, and :w[Isaac
Asimov's|] long-running popular science column. Asimov's
column, coincidentally, began in the other magazine featured in this post
(*Venture Science Fiction*) --- it was a companion to *F&SF*, and the column
moved to there with the end of *VSF*.

# Venture Science Fiction, May 1969

::fig[*Venture Science Fiction* cover, May 1969]{#vsf-001-001}

The horror-ish aesthetic of the cover made this one stand out and I was rewarded
with some excellent illustrations by :sfa[Bert Tanner|25140]. This issue is from
*VSF*'s second run, neither of which lasted long. The magazine did have some
impact though: the first publication of :w[Sturgeon's Law] was in *VSF*, and
Asimov's popsci column began here, as mentioned above. It also published
:w[Vonda N. McIntyre's|] first story, and an early story by :w[James Tiptree
Jr.]
