I've decided to build Majesty's user interface using Svelte components, and
spent some time integrating Phaser and Svelte and building a small example
project.

**The example project :i[can be seen here|gallery>phaser-svelte-ui-example].**

Until now I've been using Phaser's limited UI facilities to create buttons and
the like, so this will open up a lot of possibilities going forward, although I
still need to integrate this work with the actual game. I don't have many
screenshots this time because this isn't too interesting, but the UI can be seen
in the example.
