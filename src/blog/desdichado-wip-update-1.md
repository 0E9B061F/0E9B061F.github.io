Long time without an update. Since the last one I've learned some CAD and I've
done some work on an old game project called Desdichado.

# Desdichado

Desdichado is a turn-based tactics game project I began a couple years ago.
Since returning to it I've primarily been working on art, specifically the model
for a character named Ril, and I've also made modifications to my custom cel
shader. Here's what Ril looks like:

:::gal
::fig{#dwip-001}
::fig{#dwip-002}
::fig{#dwip-003}
::fig{#dwip-004}
::fig{#dwip-005}
::fig{#dwip-006}
::fig{#dwip-007}
:::

# CAD

I've also taught myself a bit of CAD, using CadQuery. I had a lot of fun with
this and enjoyed creating models with code instead of the 3D modeling experience
I'm used to. In particular it allowed me to adjust the entire model on the fly
quickly - a single common measure can be changed at once instead of editing the
mesh of every part using that measure.

I designed a few things, including this small LED lamp:

:::gal
::fig{#cadwip-001}
::fig{#cadwip-002}
::fig{#cadwip-003}
