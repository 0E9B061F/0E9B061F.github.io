A rewrite of :gh[|0E9B061F/fantasma.js] is progressing and mostly complete now.

The goal of the rewrite is to clean up and simplify the code, implement new
features and improve test coverage. Remaining work will focus on improving the
animation declaration syntax, to make it less verbose and more intuitive, plus
documentation (a README is desperately needed).

* Current work can be found om the :gh[rewrite|0E9B061F/fantasma.js/tree/rewrite] branch.
* :i[An example built using the rewrite|gallery>fantasma-example] can be seen in the Gallery.
