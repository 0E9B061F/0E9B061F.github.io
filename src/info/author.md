# Hello there, my name is `0E9B061F`

And I'm a programmer. Welcome to my website. I do front- and back-end web
development ([CPB][cpb], [fantasma.js][fantasma], [waxwing.js][waxwing]). I
write system tools ([scroll][scroll], [hashbeam][hashbeam],
[imgfilter][imgfilter]) and I'm interested in parsing ([ghast.js][ghast],
[lexdoc][lexdoc]). I mostly work with node.js and Python currently, and I write
a lot of bash. I also have experience with Ruby, C#, and a few other languages.
I've had the misfortune of writing some R. I've been using [Svelte][svelte] a
lot lately and created [phaser-svelte-ui-example][svelteui], which uses Svelte
components as UI elements for a [Phaser][phaser] game. 

I've contributed to [svelte-markdown][svelte-md].
