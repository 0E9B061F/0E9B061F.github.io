# Hello there, my name is `0E9B061F`

And I'm a programmer. Welcome to my website. I do front- and back-end web
development (:gh[|0E9B061F/cpb], :gh[|0E9B061F/fantasma.js],
:gh[|0E9B061F/waxwing.js]). I write system tools (:gh[|0E9B061F/scroll],
:gh[|0E9B061F/hashbeam], :gh[|0E9B061F/imgfilter]) and I'm interested in parsing
(:gh[|0E9B061F/ghast.js], :gh[|0E9B061F/lexdoc]). I mostly work with node.js and
Python currently, and I write a lot of bash. I also have experience with Ruby,
C#, and a few other languages. I've had the misfortune of writing some R. I've
been using :gh[|sveltejs/svelte] a lot lately and created
:gh[|0E9B061F/phaser-svelte-ui-example], which uses Svelte components as UI
elements for a :gh[|phaserjs/phaser] game. 

I've contributed to :gh[|pablo-abc/svelte-markdown].
