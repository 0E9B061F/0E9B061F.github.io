This cheatsheet collects commands and tools you might find useful when starting out with :e[Void Linux|{{url.void}}]. This guide will be updated as I learn .

# XBPS Package Manager

The Void package manager is :e[XBPS --- the X Binary Package System|{{url.xbps}}]. It was written from scratch for use with Void. Common commands:

* `xbps-install -Su` --- update the system
* `xbps-install PACKAGE` --- install PACKAGE
* `xbps-query -Rs QUERY` --- search repositories for packages
* `xbps-query -f PACKAGE` --- list files provided by PACKAGE
* `xbps-query -l` --- list all packages with versions and descriptions
* `xbps-query -l | cut -d " " -f 2 | sed "s/^\(.*\)-.*$/\1/"` --- list all package names (might want to alias this)

Install `xtools` for additional tools:

* `xlocate -S | QUERY` --- search for paths within all packages. Useful to find which package a command is in, etc.
  * Run `xlocate -S` first to cache package data. Run occasionally to keep the cache updated
  * Use like `xlocate /usr/bin/dig`. Absolute paths work best; `xlocate npm` returns 2716 results, `xlocate /usr/bin/npm` returns one.
* `xcheckrestart [-v]` --- XBPS does not restart services when they're updated. Run this to check for services that need to be restarted.

# Service Management

Services are managed with the `sv` command. Usage examples:

* `sv up SERVICES` --- start a service and re-start it as needed
* `sv down SERVICES` --- stop a service and do not restart it
* `sv restart SERVICES`
* `sv status SERVICES`
* `ls /var/service` --- contains symlinks for all running services
* `sv s /var/service/*` --- show status of all running services

Install `:gh[rubyists/sv-helper]` for some additional tools:

* `sv-list` --- list all available services
* `svls SERVICE` --- like `sv-list` but you can limit output to a single SERVICE
* `sv-enable SERVICE` -- enable a service to start at boot, and start it now
* `sv-disable SERVICE` -- stop a service from starting at boot, and stop it now

# Managing old kernels

Old kernels are not removed when new ones are built, to allow you rollback to previous versions. This will eventually cause your `/boot` partition to run out of space, causing update errors and kernel panics.

You can manage old kernel versions using `vkpurge`:

* `vkpurge list` --- list unused, removable kernels
* `vkpurge rm all` --- remove all removable kernels
* `vkpurge rm '2.6.*' 4.3.4_1` --- remove all removable kernels matching a pattern, and remove a specific version
