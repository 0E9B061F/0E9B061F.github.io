I've been doing game dev stuff, working on a project I'm calling **Majesty**. So
far this has revolved around generating heightmaps with Perlin noise and then
extracting information from the generated map, such as steepness and site
suitability for spawning or founding cities. I've generated a number of poorly
cropped screenshots in the process, which I'll dump here:
