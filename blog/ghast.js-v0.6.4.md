Updated :european_castle: [ghast.js](https://github.com/0E9B061F/ghast.js) to `v0.6.4`.
The last update had the wrong version in the README (orz). This fixes that and belatedly updates the year to 2023.

[The project's documentation](/docs/ghast.js) has also been updated to reflect these changes.

# CHANGES

* Update version number and year in `README.md`
